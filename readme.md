# Scrapbook Theme

The Scrapbook theme was originally developed for danandsherree.com in 2005. Since then it's received a handful of updates, but the 2005 templates are really showing their age. Some day I hope to create a new design for danandsherree.com, and when that happens I would like to have Scrapbook preserved. And that's what this is: an attempt to preserve some work from many years ago.

As you can imagine, a lot of the capabilities we now take for granted when building a theme did not exist in 2005. Some effort is being made to update Scrapbook to modern practices including the flexibility necessary for other sites to use Scrapbook -- but in its current state you'll find a lot of hard-coded references to us, and the way the design originally worked.
