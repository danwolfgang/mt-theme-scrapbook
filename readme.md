# Scrapbook Theme

The Scrapbook theme was originally developed for [danandsherree.com](http://danandsherree.com) in 2005. Some day I hope to create a new design for danandsherree.com, and when that happens I would like to have Scrapbook preserved. And that's what this is: an attempt to preserve some work from many years ago.

As you can imagine, a lot of the capabilities we now take for granted when building a theme did not exist in 2005. Effort is being made to update Scrapbook to modern practices including the flexibility necessary for other sites to use Scrapbook: you'll find that Theme Options exist for you to customize Scrapbook for your site.
